STATUS: We're not dead, just barely moving! I haven't been playing dice games much so this falls off my mind a lot. Development will pick up on this again with a focus on bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.

This is a dice app (basically a fancy random number generator) for use in dice-based RPGs. Currently, I support your typical DnD type setting and another setting called Anima (open rolls).

REQUIRES: .NET Framework 4.8

Current features include:

Straight math (Ex: 2+2)
Dice rolling (Ex: 2d6 generates a value between 2 and 12)
Modifiers/basic math (Ex: 2d6+13/2)
Multiple dice sets (Ex: 2d6+2d8+13/2)
Mathematical Order of Precedence (Ex: "100/(2d6+2)")
Anima: Open Rolls (Rolls that you can add together on a value of 90 or above)
Reroll certain values or lower (Ex: Brutal weapons in DnD4 never roll 1s, and some never roll 2s)
Rerolling last roll (For those DMs that have multiple minions with all the same formula)
Stored formulas (You can store a formula to run later)
Variables (stored formulas can be given a label to be run within other formulas)
...and more! (Features that I've forgotten to add to this list as I put them over the development of the app)
Known Issues:

Somewhere along in the recoding of things, we lost the use of the reroll checkbox...a new implementation of it is on the list!
